## Also a brief revisit to Win32 API programming.

I was looking for a simple screensaver with digital hours and minutes display.

A quick Googling brings lots of hits, but most of them look slightly unsafe, otherwise dubious, or overcomplicated. Screensavers are maybe the easiest way of distributing malicious code to unsuspecting Windows users.

My solution: Write one myself.

## Choice of font

Most proportionally spaced fonts have fixed width digits to allow easy alignment of numeric data. The disadvantage of this is that when displaying numbers with narrow digits, like "11" for example, the gap between digits looks too wide compared to a pair of wider digits, like "00" or "88".


## Abril Fatface Regular 

Luckily I found a font that has elegant, strikingly unique, and visually interesting digits.
